			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>The 38 flower remedies (plus the emergency formula, a.k.a. Rescue Remedy) were discovered in the 1920s and 30s by Dr. Edward Bach, a British physician who wanted to find a gentler form of medicine. Through his research, Dr. Bach found that treating the individual at the level of the personality was effective and empowering for healing. He left behind a complete and simple system of complementary healing as gift to all who would like to learn to use it.

			<h2>Why I am a Bach Flower Remedies Practitioner</h2>
			<div class='container'>
				<p>
					I first tried the Bach flowers in the late 90s while working in a spa as an esthetician. I was drawn to the idea that flower drops could address specific emotions, and I was also skeptical. I decided to try Star of Bethlehem to work through old trauma, and it was transformative for me. I have been working with the Bach flowers ever since, and became a practitioner in 2013.
					<br><br>
					Currently, I am training to teach Bach Basics, a Bach Foundation approved, introductory course available in the United States, and I am also  a graduate student in depth psychology and somatic studies. As I continue to work with the remedies, I find they are instrumental in my self-care and that of my clients, offering more awareness, and gently mobilizing old or stuck patterns.
					<br><br>
					I find the remedies to be more relevant now than ever, as many people of all ages want to find effective ways to manage stress and grow in new ways. I hope youâ€™ll try this simple, self-help system for yourself.

			<h2>Some Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<p id='q1'>Q: Do I need to tell you all the details of my life in order to find the remedies I need to take?</p>
			<p>A: No. It is not necessary to disclose a lot of specific details. We are trying to find the feelings and mental states that need attention. Many people find it works for them to explain their current circumstances, but this is a personal preference.</p>
			<p id='q2'>Q: Are my sessions confidential?</p>
			<p>A: Yes. BFRPs are bound by a Code of Practice which states that practitioners are to provide a safe and confidential environment for consultation. If a practioner shares a case with a mentor (also bound by the Code of Practice), the identifying information will be omitted to protect the client. Please email me with questions about records.</p>
			<p id='q3'>Q: If I am taking other herbs, medications, or other therapies will the Bach flowers interfere with them?</p>
			<p>A: No. The Bach flower remedies do not interfere or react negatively with medication or other herbal therapies. It is best however, to consult the medical or other practioner who prescribed or recommended your course of treatment. The Bach flower system is a complementary system, and not a substitute for medication or medical care.</p>
